# Scrape.do Scrapers

_Stop relying on overpriced APIs for popular domains!_ 🤚🏻

This repository contains scraping samples for the most scraped domains on the web, with full-length tutorials and functioning scrapers mainly built with Python and NodeJS (_NodeJS files included in separate folders_).

Scrapers in this repository are programmed to help you understand the basics of scraping these popular websites and serving as a base for you to customize and use in your own projects.

For Python, you'll be using: 
- __Python 3.8+__, 
- [__Requests__](https://github.com/psf/requests) for handling HTTP requests, 
- [__Beautiful Soup__](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) for parsing information, 
- and [__urllib.parse__](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html) for URL encoding.

This repository also uses [Scrape.do](https://scrape.do/)'s web scraping API, __to bypass Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)__ of the domains you're scraping and also __interacting with the browser__.
