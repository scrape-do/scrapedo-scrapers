## How to Use: `scrapeProductInfo.py`

1. Copy the full product URL from Allegro, example:<br>`https://allegro.pl/oferta/macbook-air-m2-13-6-16gb-256gb-space-gray-16784193631`

2. In the script, replace:

   ```

Product Price: 5999.00
Product Rating: 4.8
```

## Technical Details

### Data Extraction Method
The scraper uses HTML selectors and microdata to extract product information from Allegro product pages:

- **Product name**: Targets `h1` header element
- **Price extraction**: Uses `meta[itemprop="price"]` microdata content
- **Rating extraction**: Uses `span[data-testid="aggregateRatingValue"]` selector
- **Polish geo-targeting**: Uses `geoCode=pl` parameter for accessing Poland-restricted content

### Element Selectors Used
- Product title: `h1`
- Price: `meta[itemprop="price"][content]`
- Rating: `span[data-testid="aggregateRatingValue"]`

### API Configuration
The script uses specific Scrape.do parameters:
- `render=false`: Static HTML parsing (faster performance)
- `geoCode=pl`: **Polish geo-targeting for regional access (REQUIRED)**
- `super=true`: **Premium proxy routing with Polish residential IPs (ESSENTIAL)**

### Protection & Access Requirements
Allegro has **extremely strict geo-restrictions** and requires:
- **Polish residential IP addresses** (provided via `super=true`)
- **Heavy JavaScript rendering** for full content access (some products may need `render=true`)
- **Regional compliance** - content only accessible from Poland

## Common Errors

**403 or 429:** Heavy geo-restrictions triggered; requires Polish residential IPs via `super=true`<br>**Regional access denied:** Allegro blocks non-Polish traffic; `geoCode=pl` with premium routing essential<br>**Missing content:** Some products may require `render=true` for JavaScript-heavy pages<br>**Element not found:** Product may not exist or page structure changed<br>**Price/rating missing:** Microdata format may vary for different product types

## Output Format

The script outputs key product information directly to console for quick Polish e-commerce market analysis and price monitoring.

- Electronics and computers
