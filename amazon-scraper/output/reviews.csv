R3RLD0APXNJJH2,4.0,"April 4, 2023","Love the CK boxers but they are really tight if you are endowed with an average or above average package. They will shrink down a size after the first wash so I regret not ordering up a size to compensate for material shrinkage and then the lack of room in the pouch. My shaft and balls are always slipping out of these boxers so I really should have ordered one size up but you never know how things fit these days until you try it I guess. Like I said, I do like these boxers because they look hot, it’s just a lot of adjusting wearing these all day when you don’t get the right size.Read more",9
R160QVDFUFE4YB,1.0,"June 19, 2025","Why did you pick this product vs others?:I've purchased CK trunks before of a similar style (different fabric) and have been pleased with them. This 5 pack was discounted to a very good price.Quality:Poor, which is perhaps the reason they were discounted. The fabric bags out immediately after putting them on and stays that way leaving no support in the crotch and sloppy leg openings that bunch and ride up.Value for money:Expected to be good based on price, but not so much when you can't were themWearability:Poor. The fabric bags out immediately after putting them on and stays that way leaving no support in the crotch and sloppy leg openings that bunch and ride up.​Value for money:Color:Black as black should be.Breathable:AverageLook:Good for the first half hour, then sloppy like boxers.Read more",0

RIFLHOUOWDSLC,2.0,"December 7, 2025","These fit my waist but they are too “low rise”. It feels like the root of my Johnson is showing, and god help us if I get excited while wearing these.I bought these to look sexy for my wife, but when Major Johnson stands at attention it is very uncomfortable and his battle helmet sticks out the top.Read more",0
