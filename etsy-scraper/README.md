# Etsy Scraper

This folder contains Python scripts to scrape **product listings**, **single product details**, and **product reviews** from Etsy using [Scrape.do](https://scrape.do).

Scrape.do helps bypass Etsy's anti-bot mechanisms including DataDome, rate limits, and CAPTCHAs.

All scripts use publicly accessible HTML data and require no login or authentication.

## Common Notes

* **Geo-targeting:** All scrapers use `geoCode=us` for US-based results. Change this to target different regions.
* **Super Mode:** All scrapers use `super=true` for enhanced anti-bot bypass capabilities.
* **Extra Headers:** Category and product scrapers use `extraHeaders=true` with custom locale headers (`sd-x-detected-locale: USD|en-US|US`) for proper currency and language targeting.
* **Error Handling:** All scrapers include try/except blocks to handle missing elements gracefully.
* **Rate Limiting:** Scripts include `time.sleep()` calls to avoid overwhelming the API.
