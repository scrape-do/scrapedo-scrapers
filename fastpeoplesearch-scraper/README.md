## Technical Details

### Data Extraction Method
The scraper uses HTML element selectors to extract person information from FastPeopleSearch profile pages:

- **Name and location parsing**: Extracts from `h1#details-header` element and splits location data
- **Age extraction**: Uses `h2#age-header` selector and removes "Age " prefix
- **Address parsing**: Targets `div#current_address_section` to find current address information
- **US geo-targeting**: Uses `geoCode=us` parameter for residential proxy routing

### Element Selectors Used
- Header information: `h1#details-header`
- Age data: `h2#age-header`
- Address section: `div#current_address_section`

### Proxy Configuration
The script uses US-based residential proxies (`geoCode=us`) which are essential for accessing FastPeopleSearch content reliably.

## Common Errors

**403 or 429:** Your IP might be blocked; the script uses US residential proxies via `geoCode=us`<br>**Element not found:** Person profile may not exist or be formatted differently<br>**Parsing errors:** Profile page structure may have changed; verify the page loads correctly<br>**Missing address data:** Some profiles may not have current address information<br>**Split errors:** Name/location format may vary for different profiles

## Output Format

The script outputs key person information directly to console for quick lookup and verification purposes.
