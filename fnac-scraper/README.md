## Technical Details

### Data Extraction Method
- **Product name**: Targets `h1` header element
- **Price extraction**: Uses specific class `f-faPriceBox__price userPrice checked`
- **French geo-targeting**: Uses `geoCode=fr` parameter for regional access
- **Premium routing**: Uses `super=true` for advanced protection bypass

### API Configuration
- `render=true`: **JavaScript rendering required for dynamic content**
- `geoCode=fr`: **French geo-targeting (REQUIRED)**
- `super=true`: **Premium routing for WAF and rate-limit bypass**

### Protection Bypass
Fnac uses **custom WAF** (Web Application Firewall) and **aggressive rate-limiting** that are automatically bypassed using Scrape.do's premium proxy network and advanced anti-bot detection evasion.

## Common Errors

**403 or 429:** Custom WAF or rate-limiting triggered; premium routing via `super=true` required<br>**Rate-limiting errors:** Aggressive rate-limiting bypassed through premium proxy rotation<br>**French geo-targeting needed:** Content only accessible from France via `geoCode=fr`<br>**JavaScript rendering required:** Product pages need full rendering for dynamic pricing
