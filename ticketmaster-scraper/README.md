## How to Use: `scrapeEventDetails.py`

1. Copy the full artist URL from TicketMaster, example:<br>`https://www.ticketmaster.com/post-malone-tickets/artist/2119390`

2. In the script, replace:

   ```python
   token = "<your_token>"
   target_url = "<target_artist_url>"
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python scrapeEventDetails.py
   ```

## Technical Details

### Data Extraction Method
The scraper uses regex to extract JSON-LD structured data from TicketMaster artist pages:

- **JSON-LD extraction**: Uses regex pattern `<script type="application/ld\+json">(.*?)</script>`
- **Event iteration**: Loops through all events in the structured data array
- **Location parsing**: Extracts venue names and full addresses from nested location objects
- **US geo-targeting**: Uses `geoCode=us` parameter for accessing US-based content

### Regex Pattern Used
```python
r'<script type="application/ld\+json">(.*?)</script>'
```
Extracts JSON-LD structured data containing all event information.

### API Configuration
The script uses specific Scrape.do parameters:
- `render=false`: Static HTML parsing (faster performance for JSON-LD extraction)
- `geoCode=us`: US geo-targeting for regional access
- `super=true`: Premium proxy routing for reliability

### Heavy JavaScript Requirements
TicketMaster uses **extensive JavaScript rendering** for dynamic content. While this scraper uses static parsing for performance, some pages may require:
- `render=true`: For JavaScript-heavy dynamic content
- **Extended processing time** for complex artist pages
- **Premium routing** to handle anti-bot measures

## Common Errors

**403 or 429:** TicketMaster protection triggered; premium proxies via `super=true` required<br>**JSON parsing errors:** Structured data format may have changed or be missing<br>**No events found:** Artist may not have upcoming events or page structure changed<br>**Heavy JS rendering needed:** Some pages may require `render=true` for full content access<br>**Regional restrictions:** Content may vary by geographic location

## Output Format

The script outputs comprehensive event information directly to console for quick tour schedule analysis and venue tracking.

## Supported Content Types

- Artist tour pages and schedules
