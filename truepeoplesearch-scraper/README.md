## Technical Details

### Data Extraction Method
The scraper uses data attributes and schema.org microdata to extract person information from TruePeopleSearch profile pages:

- **Name extraction**: Uses `data-fn` and `data-ln` attributes from `div#personDetails`
- **Age extraction**: Uses `data-age` attribute from person details div
- **Address parsing**: Targets schema.org microdata with `itemprop` attributes
- **Phone extraction**: Uses `data-link-to-more="phone"` selector with telephone microdata
- **US geo-targeting**: Uses `geoCode=us` parameter for residential proxy routing

### Element Selectors Used
- Person details: `div#personDetails` with data attributes
- Address link: `a[data-link-to-more="address"]`
- Street address: `span[itemprop="streetAddress"]`
- City: `span[itemprop="addressLocality"]`
- State: `span[itemprop="addressRegion"]`
- Phone: `a[data-link-to-more="phone"] span[itemprop="telephone"]`

### Proxy Configuration
The script uses US-based residential proxies (`geoCode=us`) which are essential for accessing TruePeopleSearch content reliably.
