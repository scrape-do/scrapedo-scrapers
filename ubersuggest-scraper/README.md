# Ubersuggest Scraper

[Find full technical guide here üìî](https://scrape.do/blog/ubersuggest-scraping/)

This repository includes Python scripts to extract keyword data and search engine result pages (SERPs) directly from Ubersuggest using [Scrape.do](https://scrape.do). It bypasses Ubersuggest‚Äôs bot protection by rotating proxies, handling headers, and injecting bearer tokens.

All scripts use publicly accessible API endpoints, no login required.

‚ö† This guide was created for research and educational purposes and our approach of bypassing Ubersuggest using Bearer Tokens might be invalid in the near future.

## What‚Äôs Included

* `bearerTokenGenerator.py`: Extracts a temporary Bearer token from Ubersuggest's network.
* `keywordOverview.py`: Fetches volume, CPC, SEO difficulty, and paid difficulty for any keyword.
* `SERPresults.py`: Retrieves full SERP breakdown (URLs, titles, positions, clicks, domain authority).
* `keywordOverviewAutoBearer.py`: Automates both bearer token generation and keyword lookup.

## Requirements

* Python 3.7+
* `requests` library, install with:

  ```bash
  pip install requests
  ```
* A [Scrape.do API token](https://dashboard.scrape.do/signup) (**1000 free credits/month**)

## üîç How to Use Each Script

### `bearerTokenGenerator.py`

**Fetches a temporary Bearer token used by Ubersuggest‚Äôs APIs.**

1. Replace the API token:

   ```python
   scrape_token = "<your-token>"
   ```
2. Run:

   ```bash
   python bearerTokenGenerator.py
   ```

Returns a Bearer token that you can plug into other scripts.

### `keywordOverview.py`

**Gets keyword volume, CPC, SEO difficulty, and paid difficulty for a given keyword.**

1. Replace your API and bearer tokens:

   ```python
   scrape_token = "<your-token>"
   bearer_token = "app#unlogged__XXXX..."
   ```
2. Set your keyword and region:

   ```python
   keyword = "ubersuggest"
   locId = 2840  # USA
   ```
3. Run:

   ```bash
   python keywordOverview.py
   ```

Returns a summary like:

```text
Keyword: ubersuggest
Volume : 22,200
CPC    : $3.17
SEO Difficulty: 40
Paid Difficulty: 37
```

### `SERPresults.py`

**Pulls the full organic SERP from Ubersuggest‚Äôs backend API.**

1. Replace API and bearer tokens:

   ```python
   scrape_token = "<your-token>"
   bearer_token = "app#unlogged__XXXX..."
   ```
2. Run:

   ```bash
   python SERPresults.py
   ```

Outputs a list of ranking URLs with position, title, clicks, domain, and authority.

### `keywordOverviewAutoBearer.py`

**End-to-end script that fetches a fresh Bearer token and retrieves keyword overview data.**

1. Replace your Scrape.do token:

   ```python
   scrape_token = "<your-token>"
   ```
2. Run:

   ```bash
   python keywordOverviewAutoBearer.py
   ```

No need to manually handle headers or bearer tokens.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Limitations

* Each Bearer token is temporary; you must refresh it frequently.
* Use realistic delays or caching to avoid wasting API credits.
* Data comes from public APIs used by Ubersuggest frontend; no login required.
* We do not condone large-scale scraping using this method, which can become unethical very quickly.

## üìà Why Use Scrape.do?

Scrape.do handles the heavy lifting so you don‚Äôt have to:

* Bypass WAFs and geo-blocks
* Inject custom headers and bearer tokens
* Works on JS-heavy, API-backed tools
* 1000 API requests/month for free
