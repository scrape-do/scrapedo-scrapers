## Files:

* restaurantInfo.py â€“ Extracts restaurant name, address, rating, price, etc.
* deliveryMenu.py â€“ Extracts structured delivery menus with item names, categories, and prices.

## Requirements:

Run `pip install requests beautifulsoup4` to install dependencies.

## Usage:

1. Add your Scrape.do API token to each script before running.
2. Run the scraper you want to use:<br>`python restaurantInfo.py`<br>`python deliveryMenu.py`

âš  Example Zomato URLs are hardcoded in the scripts; replace them with your own targets.
